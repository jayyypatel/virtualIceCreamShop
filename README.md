Our app is like having a virtual ice cream shop at your fingertips! Picture this: you're not just running any old ice cream joint—you're managing everything from when customers walk in the door to when they leave with a smile on their face (and a cone in hand). We've built a nifty tool that lets you see how everything works in real-time, from the moment customer’s show up to when they place their orders and head out the door.

Now, here's where things get interesting. In the final phase of our project, we added a cool feature: randomness. Yep, we decided to sprinkle in a bit of unpredictability to make things more lifelike. With our fancy random number generator, each time you run the simulation, it's like rolling the dice—you never know exactly what's going to happen. Maybe a big group of friends arrives all at once, or maybe it's just a quiet day with a few solo ice cream enthusiasts. Either way, it keeps things exciting!

Our application simulates the operations of an ice cream shop, providing insights into customer arrivals, service times, and overall shop dynamics. In earlier phases, we built the foundation of the simulation, modeling customer arrivals, serving orders, and departures. However, in this final phase, we introduced a crucial element of randomness to our simulation. By leveraging a random number generator, we added variability to factors such as group sizes, time between arrivals, and duration of customer stays. This enhancement adds depth and realism to our simulation, mirroring the unpredictable nature of real-world scenarios.


The simulation tracks the arrivals of customer groups, assigns orders, and schedules departures based on randomized parameters. Each iteration of the simulation offers a unique experience, as the timing and size of customer arrivals, as well as their interactions with the shop, vary dynamically. Through detailed logging and statistical analysis, users gain insights into customer behavior, shop utilization, and operational efficiency.

By completing Phase 6, our simulation achieves a higher level of fidelity, capturing the inherent randomness and complexity of real-world ice cream shop operations. Users can run simulations with confidence, knowing that the outcomes reflect plausible scenarios influenced by randomized factors. This enhanced capability enables users to explore various strategies, optimize resources, and make informed decisions in a simulated environment that closely mirrors reality.
